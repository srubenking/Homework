#### Overall

This is very good work. Specifically, the solutions to 5-6 are excellent, and while the output of 7 is correct, the solution doesn't quite conform to the assignment.

#### Correctness

Good. In Problem 7, the regex does split the sentences, but it doesn't do so by looking for ends of lines. This makes the last part of the problem much easier, because you don't have each line in two parts to be rejoined.

#### Readability

Excellent.

#### Documentation

Also excellent.

#### Efficiency

Good. See my comments on Problem 6, where things are more complicated than they need to be.
