#### Overall

This is very good work overall. Problems 1-2 are excellent, as are the annotations.

_Note: Since the assignment's split up this week, I've broken this week's comments down by problem instead of criteria._

#### Problem 1

This is great. If you really wanted to split up the control and the raising cases, you could do another search looking for dummy subjects in the matrix clause to identify those verbs.

#### Problem 2

Excellent! Nicely done. See my note on how to get the verb strings out of `matchtree`; doing a regex is overkill when you can use `.leaves()[0]`.

#### Problem 3

This is a good start. Take a look at the notes from the final section to see one way to tackle this.

#### Problem 4

Excellent.

#### Problem 5

Some questions on your codebook:

- "If a line seems to fit multiple types, choose the most appropriate one." Say more.
- Is "Tarantino's other films" a tag-worthy reference to other movies?
