#### Overall

This is excellent work. A lot of thought has been put into writing code that can scale up as needed, like with that list of punctuation. My main advice is to try to avoid manual counters; they're rarely needed when you have for loops.

#### Correctness

Everything does what it's supposed to. Nicely done.

#### Readability

The counter thing hurts readablity, so avoid that as much as possible. We can count in the things we're dealing with instead.

#### Documentation

These are very effective comments.

#### Efficiency

The first character of a word gets checked against the vowels twice. It's not a big deal, but it's also not necessary.
